# Rider instructions

In Rider, open the solution. 
The application can be run by using the play button.
The unit tests can be run by right clicking the **RoverNav.Test** project and selecting *Run Unit Tests*.

# Notes

The app does not take user inputs, as I believe it was outsid the scope of the challange, Instead the test case variables are hardcoded in order for the app to run, however, user input and input validation can easily be added. 
The unit tests include a testcase where the rover moves off the grid.
